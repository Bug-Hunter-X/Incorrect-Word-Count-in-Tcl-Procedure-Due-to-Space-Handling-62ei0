# Tcl Word Counting Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl when counting words in a string. The `count_words` procedure incorrectly handles multiple spaces between words, resulting in an inaccurate word count.

The bug is demonstrated in `bug.tcl`, and a corrected version is provided in `bugSolution.tcl`.
